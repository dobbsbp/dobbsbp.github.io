OK, so I think using Facebook as a blogging platform is not very effective. This should make it easier for me to both share data and also share project I'm working on. 

Here's a list of current projects I am working on (ranked by priority) :

1. <b>CNC Machine</b>: Building an affordable and effective cnc machine for less than $300

2,<b>Touch device similar to Makey-Makey:  Makey-Makey is often too expensive in Indonesia with asking prices anywhere around 650,000-850,000 rupiah.  It can be made for much less and be more available to the public. I've been working in a controller and i figure i could easily make a small box and have the PCB fit on top with the arduino controller underneath.  Controller would be similar to a NES controller but also have some pinouts for additional connections.  I'm considering adding a switch to change functions (mouse/keyboard/key assignment). 

3. <b>Galileo</b>: Learn more about the Galileo device and make it do something IoT related. 

4. <b>Arduino Lock</b>: build a lock for a friend who often gets anxiety over not knowing if they locked their door or not.  Considering making an esp8266 version for online checking, but will make uno version first. 

5. <b>3.3v power supply</b>: I want to make my own dedicated 3.3v power supply from an AMS1117 regulator to use with esp projects. Will be made on pcb engraved by cnc machine. 

6. <b>Esp12e breakout</b>: I'd like it to be in a useful form so it can be easily used for projects. Breakout to include 3.3v regulator and micro USB connection for power and a flash button. Will have to wait and see how the design goes as I only have single layer pcb to work with. It's pretty cheap at rp1,500 per 90mmx90mm sheet. Double costs a bit more and might be tricky for alignment with cnc machine.... We shall see... 

7. <b>Laser cutter/engraver</b>: to be used with cnc machine. 

8. <b>Wooden swing</b>: for my daughter... Maybe I should up this on the priority list.  Shouldn't take very long  to make as I have all the wood already.  

9. <b>Raspberry pi2</b>: I'm considering using it to host a website for myself.  I'm considering registering a domain and have it directed to whatever my home ip address is, although now that I've typed this out I am feeling like maybe that's not such a great idea for security reasons. This is low on the priority list anyways, so I'll get back to this later. 

I'm sure there's other projects I have in mind but it's late and that's all that comes to mind at the moment.  If you have inputs or questions about any projects, let me know.  No need to be shy. 

Goodnight!
